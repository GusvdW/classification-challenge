# classification-challenge
# In this assignment I have created two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluated which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models I created was a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest model. 
# The dataset provided contained information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam.
# I predicted that the Random Forest model will perform better as it can handle more complex scenario's.
# In the end, my prediction was correct as the Random Forest model performed slightly better than the Logistic Regression Model.
